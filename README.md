# SQL-Project
***Getting a Step Ahead in SQL!***

**Repository Description:**

Welcome to the SQL Advanced project repository for the IG Clone dataset! 

This project aims to demonstrate advanced SQL querying skills through analysis and manipulation of a dataset designed to mimic the schema of a social media platform, specifically an Instagram clone. The schema is available as a file named `ig_clone_data`. 

**Dataset Overview:**
- The dataset comprises multiple tables representing various aspects of a social media platform, including users, posts, comments, likes, and follows.
- Each table is interconnected through primary and foreign keys, enabling complex querying and analysis.

**Key Features:**
1. **Advanced Queries:** This project showcases complex SQL queries involving multiple joins, subqueries, aggregates, and window functions to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
2. **Data Manipulation:** Demonstrates techniques for updating, deleting, and inserting data, crucial for maintaining database integrity.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Includes examples of optimizing queries for efficiency and scalability, such as indexing and query restructuring.
4. **Analytical Capabilities:** Utilizes SQL for analytical purposes, including trend analysis, user engagement metrics, and content recommendation systems.
5. **Data Visualization:** Some queries may include integration with visualization tools like Tableau or Python libraries for data visualization, enhancing the understanding of the data.

**Contents:**
- **SQL Queries:** Contains a variety of SQL scripts demonstrating different aspects of querying, manipulation, and analysis of the IG Clone dataset.
- **Documentation:** Provides detailed explanations of the dataset schema, query rationale, and any specific considerations.

**Note** - 'MYSQL ADVANCED PROJECT ASSIGNMENT.docx' includes the output

- **Sample Outputs:** Includes sample outputs of query results or visualizations generated from the queries.

**How to Use:**
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
2. **Set Up the Database:** Use the `ig_clone_data` file to set up the database in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. **Run Queries:** Execute the SQL scripts in your SQL environment to explore and analyze the dataset.
4. **Explore Outputs:** Review the outputs generated by the queries to gain insights into user behavior, content trends, and more.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to this project to further enhance your SQL skills and understanding of database management. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request. Happy querying!
